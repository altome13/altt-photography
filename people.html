								hilarious. I met her the summer of 2020, when I thought the pandemic would already be
								over, at my internship.
								I met Zury, and I instantly clicked with her so much that I consider her my little
								sister. These photographs of her were taken on the day of her baptism that same summer,
								and they are representative of the caring nature and soft spirit Zury exhibits.</p>

								currently pursuing her Ph.D in Space, Sciences, and Engineering (go Alanah!) and Chris
								just
								graduated with his Master's in Nuclear Engineering.
								In August they will be officially committing to each other for the rest of their lives,
								and I
								cannot be more excited for them! I'm literally jumping out of excitement.
								These photographs capture their genuine love for each other, but also their loving and
								giving
								nature as individuals. I'm not kidding when I say giving, they feed me so well every
								time I hang
								out with them.</p>

							<summary>Meet my Best Friends</summary>
							<p id="portraits">These pictures Andréa, Jose, and Emily. They're always down to model for
								me when I
								want to
								experiment with my camera.
								Andréa and I met in 2017 at a retreat, and our friendship started when we histerically
								laughed
								at the fact that we were looking at a restaurant's menu 5 hours before
								we planned to go with the rest of our retreat group. Our friendship has existed since
								then, so
								expect more pictures of her on here soon.

								These are some of the pictures I took in 2021 for a digital photography course. Enjoy!
