		<p>There's something about photographing nature and landscapes that captures the feeling when I was present at the location. It's an indescribable feeling, but it is a feeling that can be felt by looking
			at a photograph. Looking at these pictures, I reminisce the feelings and experience I had at those particular instances, and I hope it makes you feel like you were there with me, too.
			This gallery incudes pictures from places I've lived in, visited recently, and photographs I may or may not be emotionally attached to. </p>

			<p>The images I have included in this gallery are shots focusing on one subject at a time. There is a lot going on around us every single day that sometimes
				we forget to focus on one thing at a time. These images are meant to freeze a moment or freeze a subject in time to shine their natural 
				beauty that is often overlooked. Whether it be the beatuiful petals on a flower that tell us what season we are in or the action of 
				someone feeding an animal, there is always something beautiful present. Like Ferris Bueller said in Ferris Bueller's Day Off: "If you don't 
				stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." </p>
